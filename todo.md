- [ ] Build shared form components in packages/ui
- [ ] Implement core CRUD operations
- [ ] Set up error handling and loading states
- [ ] Add input validation with Zod in packages/utils

- [ ] Consider adding apps/admin for admin dashboard

## üí° Nice to Have (Backlog)
- [ ] Add dark mode toggle to packages/ui theme
- [ ] Implement real-time features with Supabase subscriptions
- [ ] Add comprehensive testing suite across all packages
- [ ] Set up automated CI/CD workflows for monorepo
- [ ] Performance optimization and bundle analysis per app

## üìù Ideas & Notes
- Consider implementing progressive web app features in main app
- Research advanced Next.js 13+ patterns for optimal performance
- Plan for internationalization packages if needed in future
- Look into advanced Supabase features like Edge Functions
- Consider implementing advanced security features like 2FA
- Evaluate if separate API app is needed vs Next.js API routes
- Consider packages/types for shared TypeScript definitions
- Plan packages/hooks for shared React hooks
- Evaluate Turborepo remote caching for CI/CD optimization
